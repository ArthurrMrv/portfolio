                "content": "\nHi, I'm Arthur Morvan — a data-driven problem solver with a passion for turning complexity into clarity. My academic path, from the Toulouse School of Economics to the AIDAMS program at Paris-Saclay University, has equipped me with a solid foundation in applied mathematics, artificial intelligence, and management sciences. I thrive at the intersection of tech and strategy, where data becomes a catalyst for smart decisions and lasting impact.\n\n--------\n\nProfessionally, I've explored the full data pipeline — from engineering and governance to analysis and visualization. Whether reducing image processing times by 80% with generative AI at Thales or improving operational efficiency by over 50% at ESSEC, I aim to make every project count. My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Power BI, and more — but what drives me is the impact these tools can have on real-world problems.\n\n--------\n\nOutside of work, I lead initiatives that bring innovation to life. As Vice-President of Kryptosphere, I helped organize international hackathons and collaborated with cutting-edge partners like Google Cloud and Mistral. I'm also passionate about storytelling, music, and sports — because great ideas come from diverse experiences and curious minds."
